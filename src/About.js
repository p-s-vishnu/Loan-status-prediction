           <p class="w3-text-grey">Know your chances of getting a loan before you apply through the lender. You should only ever take out a loan if you're sure you can afford it. When figuring out how to qualify for a loan, it helps to determine your ability to qualify. Thatâ€™s why we put together this loan prequalification predictor. Just bear in mind that this loan predictor is in no way a guarantee. It is, however, a good starting point in figuring out if you can get pre-approval for a loan.</p>
